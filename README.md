# Bootstrap prototype kit

The prototype kit provides a simple way to make interactive prototypes using Bootstrap 3. These prototypes can be used to show ideas to people you work with, and to do user research.

It is based on a pared down version of the [GOV.UK Prototype kit](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_prototype_kit).
